  Fabric 2 Nov &#x27;18 Devlog: Humble Beginnings
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2018-12-09</strong></p>
<p><p>So the 7DFPS entry is <a href="https://pingfromheaven.itch.io/fabric-2-prototype">there</a> and I have a rough idea about what sort of experience I should be going for. Following the jam, I had come up with a short term plan and dived deep into development.</p>
<p>Primary thing that showed itself as a priority during the jam was editing the puzzle structure. I'll probably go deeper into the technical details in another post, but the upshot is that I divide the whole level mesh by a good amount of planes to make bending work. As a result, when I click on a wall with the intention of moving it, for example, I could only select a small part of it. To move it as a whole, I had to select many small meshes, which is super annoying when I'm trying to accomplish something. And these were the small and rather simple levels, from a bend tile count perspective. It would definitely be a big no-no when I come to the big and challenging levels, which would divide the level mesh to tens of subsets. So I went ahead and copied the scene file and did the &quot;compilation&quot; process on that scene copy, leaving the original puzzle scene untouched. Things felt like as they should be, after being done with this.</p>
<p>The later work item of the month was level colors. Now, as a programmer with artistic skills less than a parking meter's, of course I went with minimalism. Because only the thought of opening Photoshop gives me the creeps, let alone coming up with a .png file that could look decent (Fun fact, I didn't even open any image manipulation applications during the Fab2 prototype development), and setting only one color in a material editor feels like something I can actually achieve. There was this reddit post (which I failed to find now) talking about how to make stuff look good without the trained eyes of an artist. The short answer is iteration. Since I can't come up with ideas through my imagination, because I suck at imagnining things, I had to try random things at first, then have an idea about what works and what isn't. To be able to do that, I needed to cut down the iteration time to a minimum.</p>

<p>So I wrote down the list of colors that I need in game: 3 colors for the level brushes, bend tiles and end area, a few for the weapon, a couple for skybox. These colors constitute a data structure called a ColorPalette. Then through a small editor script, I assigned the actual material colors from this pre-defined color array. So in the end what I have at hand is a bunch of ColorPalette assets (which are ScriptableObjects), I drag-drop a ColorPalette somewhere and press a button and voil√†! The colors of the whole game has changed. In the future, I'll probably bind puzzles to certain ColorPalettes, but that'll come later.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm at a point where I can create and edit levels rapidly. With this under the belt, the stretch goal is to have around a dozen levels to gauge the wow-ness of the mechanic.</p>
<p>As a bottom note, I've come up with a story draft as well, but that's little more than drunk texting with its current shape. That sort of meta-game stuff is going to be discussed with people anyway, far from being a priority.</p>
<p>In December, there'll be a lot less work done, doubtless, due to the vacations and stuff. But I'll do my best.</p>
